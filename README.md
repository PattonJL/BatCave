# BatCave

I was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, but have lived in several places across the country including Chattanooga, TN, and Dallas, TX. I've spent over 15 years in sales and the service industry (SI), so I know how the work well with people, but my true passion is in technology. Whether it's hardware or software, I'm fascinated about it and want to learn and grow as much as possible.

Currently, I've just finished my Data Analytics Certificate provided by Google and the Data Analytics Certificate provided by IBM. I'm also currently enrolled in the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate to obtain more knowledge. I have to say, it's one of the best decisions I've ever made. So far, I've learned Python, R, SQL, and so much more. And, in the meantime, I continue to tend bar and make my way through this next certificate while I learn how to secure networks, learn and work with Linux, and a myriad of extraordinary new information that I'm beyond excited to obtain. 

I can't wait to get the opportunity to work in the field of technology and learn as much as I possibly can, but I know it's only the first step of many. I look forward to obtaining more knowledge and certificates to assist me on my technological journey.
